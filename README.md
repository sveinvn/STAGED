# STAGED
This is a repository for Stone Age radiocarbon dates from Southern Norway (STAGED). Please reference this database as:

Nielsen, Svein Vatsvåg 2020: STAGED2305020 (or insert the correct version), https://github.com/sveinvn/STAGED.git.

All dates have been collected and organized by Svein Vatsvåg Nielsen. The dataset includes dates used in the published research paper:

Nielsen, S. V., in press (2021). A Late Mesolithic forager dispersal caused pre-agricultural demographic transition in Norway. Oxford Journal of Archaeolology, pp. 1-23.
Nielsen, S. V., Solheim, S. and P. Persson, 2019. De-Neolithisation in southern Norway inferred from statistical modelling of radiocarbon dates, Journal of Anthropological Archaeology 53, pp. 82-91.

Museum numbers refer to the site-specific labels under which the archaeological material is stored at the university museum in question (T: NTNU University Museum in Trondheim, B: University Museum of Bergen, S: Arkeologisk Museum, University of Stavanger, C: Museum of Cultural History, University of Oslo). Blank fields in the boxes indicate that the information has not been published or that it for other reasons was not retrievable.

The dataset present dates from southern Norway older than 2999 BP. Several sites have radiocarbon dates from different carbon sources. In every case, these fields have been marked with 'unknown'. When dates were produced from samples with different wood species represented, these fields were marked with 'charcoal'. Site names are always based on original publications. A column of random ID has been added to aid research, such as statistical analyses.
